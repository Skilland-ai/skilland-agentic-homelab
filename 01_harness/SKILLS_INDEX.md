# SKILLS_INDEX

- `initial-context-building` (heavy/bootstrap): reads all available sources (inbox, harness files, root docs, existing context) and fills every context slot. Seeds backlog and decisions. Produces a gap report. Run once at project start.
- `distill-context` (heavy/manual): distills raw inbox into compact context files.
- `write-spec` (light): creates one SDD-light spec from distilled context.
- `ship-output` (light): produces the final deliverable in `04_outputs/`.
- `qa-review` (light): validates output against acceptance checklist.
- `skill-creator` (strategic/heavy): creates and iterates skills with eval loop.
- `spec-driving` (workflow/heavy): runs the reusable staged spec-driving flow in `04_outputs/spec-driving/<case_id>/`.
- `spec-driving-qa` (gate/light): reviews spec-driving stage artifacts with PASS/FAIL/BLOCKED/SKIPPED evidence.
